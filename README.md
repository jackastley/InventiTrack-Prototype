# InventiTrack
## A full stack data collection and visualisation web application

This prototype application was created to enable staff to track their data day-by-day productivity and wellbeing to gain insights into the factors that influence how they feel at work. This was only used as a proof-of-concept and has limited functionality in this earlier form.

It uses React and Bootstrap for the frontend functionality and design, NodeJS and Express for the API, PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker for containerisation and deployment.

Skills demonstrated by this application include:
* Token-based authentication
* Password encryption
* Front-end design
* Back-end development
* API design
* Containerisation
* Database configuration and querying

### To view the application, simply:
* Clone this repository
* If you do not have docker installed, install it and ensure it is running on your machine.
* Run the following in your command line:
```
docker compose up
```
